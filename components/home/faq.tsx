      question: "What types of startups can I invest in via CrowdHarbor?",
      answer:
        "CrowdHarbor partners with innovative, growth-oriented startups that are preparing for equity crowdfunding rounds on major platforms (e.g., Reg CF, Reg A). We evaluate their traction, business model, and crowdfunding readiness before presenting them to investors.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does CrowdHarbor select the crowdfunding platforms?",
      answer:
        "We leverage our trusted network of global equity-crowdfunding platforms (such as Crowdcube, StartEngine, Republic) and help match the startup with the platform that best fits its region, regulatory regime, and investor base.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the minimum investment I need to make?",
      answer:
        "Minimum investment amounts depend on the individual campaign and platform. CrowdHarbor will inform you of the terms for each opportunity. Ensure you review the details when the offering opens.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of due diligence does CrowdHarbor conduct?",
      answer:
        "We perform initial screening of startups for traction, business model, regulatory compliance readiness, campaign strategy, and investor fit. This helps raise the quality and readiness of the campaigns presented to you.",
    },
    {
      question: "How and when will I get updates on my investment?",
      answer:
        "Once you invest in a startup through a crowdfunding campaign, that platform typically provides communications and reporting. CrowdHarbor assists the startup’s preparation and launch, but follow-ups and ongoing investor updates are managed by the startup via the platform.",
    },
  ],

  founder: [
  {
    question: "Do you charge founders / take equity?",
    answer:
      "No — CrowdHarbor’s matchmaking is completely free for founders (100%). Any platform fees or success terms are set and agreed directly between you and the crowdfunding platform.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I raise, and who do you work with?",
    answer:
      "We commonly position campaigns for €200K–€8M+. We work with early-growth / pre-scale startups that have product market fit or strong pilots — especially SaaS, fintech, AI, marketplaces, hardware, and impact ventures in other categories.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the process work and how fast?",
    answer:
      "Reply with four lines (• Founder Full name & Email • Company description & website • Target raise • One-line traction). We do a quick readiness check, shortlist best-fit platforms, then deliver a warm intro to platform contacts. Most founders hear back within a few business days.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who runs the campaign and handles legal/controls?",
    answer:
      "The crowdfunding platform assigns an expert campaign manager who builds and runs the raise. Legal terms, investor agreements, and campaign decisions are managed between you and the platform — CrowdHarbor only facilitates the warm intro and coordination.",
  },
  {
    question: "What outcomes can I expect?",
    answer:
      "You get targeted platform matches, a platform-provided campaign manager, and a faster path to launch — increasing your odds compared to blind applications. Exact results depend on traction and preparation, but our founder-first approach removes upfront cost and reduces wasted time.",
  },
